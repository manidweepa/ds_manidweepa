# Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment Analysis

This project explores the relationship between trader performance and Bitcoin market sentiment
(Fear vs Greed). The analysis focuses on profitability, risk exposure, trading volume, and
behavioral patterns to derive sentiment-aware trading insights.

## Objective
To analyze how trading behavior aligns or diverges from market sentiment, uncover hidden
patterns, and generate insights that can support smarter trading strategies.

  in the repository.
- Trade size and transaction fees are used as proxies for risk exposure where explicit leverage
  data is unavailable.
